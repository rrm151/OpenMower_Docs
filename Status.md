Done List
- Verify YFC-500 works
- Need more stuff on my done list.  :-)

ToDo List
- Oops, I already have a ToDo list file in the main folder.
- Hmm.  Maybe I should keep the "Done List" there also?

Today 2023-12-20
- Load Ublox U-Center on a laptop.
-     Get mower RTK configuration file.
-     Set up mower RTK board
-     Set up base station RTK board
- RPi4 Setup
-     Get OM RPi docker image.
-     Format uSD card and install image.
-         Boot and verify some stuff.

Soon ToDo List
- Determine connectors.
-     YFC500 connector  <--->   OM connector
-     Make plan to build adapter cables.
I don't know that I want to cut connectors off of the YFC-500.  I hope to find a way to make adapters or adapter cables so that I don't need to destroy the YFC.  
Half because I hate destroying working equipment, half because I would like to have a safety net for this project.  If I can't get OM to work, I can at least install a wire fence and have it mow my lawn.
