#H RRM OpenMower TODO list

- __SOON__ Figure out why this isn't interpreted as markdown text.
- .... I think change file extension to .md
- __ASAP__ Determine if I have a micro HDMI cable for Pi4 Pi5.
- If not, order micro HDMI cable.
- Determine if there is any advance RPi things I can do.
- __SOON__ Clear off basement workbench and island.
- Determine if there is any advance things I can do with the Ardusimple hardware while waiting for the rest.
- Research connectors and adapter proto boards.
- .... Not sure I can bear to cut connectors off of a brand new YardForce.  Would rather add adapters.
- __LOW PRIORITY__ Open up my old Friendly Robotics Robomower and poke around.
