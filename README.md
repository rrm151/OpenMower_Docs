RMyers notes logbook documents for OpenMower

This is a repository for storing and maintaining my notes so that I can access them on all of my devices.
A side benefit is that, if they ever seem worthy enough, it will also be easy to share them with the OpenMower community.
To be clear, it's the notes that may not be sufficiently worthy.  I assume the OpenMower community is a good group of people.
