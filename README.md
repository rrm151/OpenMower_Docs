RMyers notes logbook documents for OpenMower

This is a repository for storing and maintaining my notes so that I can access them on all of my devices.
A side benefit is that, if they ever seem worthy enough, it will also be easy to share them with the OpenMower community.
To be clear, it's the notes that may not be sufficiently worthy.  I assume the OpenMower community is a good group of people.

In case it isn't immediately obvious, I don't know markdown formatting, and I can't figure out yet how to use the Silk browser on my new Fire tablet to make this look at all nice.  I also don't know yet how I will clone, edit, and commit from my Fire tablet.  But it's all going to be a learning process.  Supposedly, that's part of the fun, if you believe in that sort of stuff.
